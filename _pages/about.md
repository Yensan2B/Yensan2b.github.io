## About me
I'm full-stack web developer who studied at John Abbott College. I love coding in C# and JavaScript, and I'm very interested in the field of AIðŸ‘½ and game developmentðŸŽ®.

I was unsure about my path until I discover what coding is and the wonder of making applications come to life. This newfound fascination led me to pursue a degree in computer science at John Abbott CollegeðŸŽ“. My ultimate aspiration is to delve into the exciting realm of artificial intelligence.

Beyond my coding adventures, I have a penchant for continuous learning and personal growth. Currently, I'm immersing myself in learning the guitarðŸŽ¸, mastering the art of the Japanese languageðŸ—¾, and staying fit with regular workoutsðŸ’ª. Life, for me, is all about taking it easy, finding relaxation in the journey, and savoring every moment along the wayðŸš©.
