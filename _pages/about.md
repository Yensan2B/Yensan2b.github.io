## 🍂 About me
I'm full-stack web developer who studied at John Abbott College. I love coding in C# and JavaScript, and I'm very interested in the field of AI👽 and game development🎮.

I was unsure about my path until I discover what coding is and the wonder of making applications come to life. This newfound fascination led me to pursue a degree in computer science at John Abbott College🎓. My ultimate aspiration is to delve into the exciting realm of artificial intelligence.

Beyond my coding adventures, I have a penchant for continuous learning and personal growth. Currently, I'm immersing myself in learning the guitar🎸, mastering the art of the Japanese language🗾, and staying fit with regular workouts💪. Life, for me, is all about taking it easy, finding relaxation in the journey, and savoring every moment along the way🚩.

## 📖 What I learned
**👥Collaborative work👥**
<br>

During my programming studies at school, I learned the importance of effective collaboration. Using Git and branching allowed me and my classmates to work simultaneously on the same project, minimizing conflicts.

We also adopted the Scrum methodology for organization and communication. Handling deadlines and conflicts through open communication taught us the value of adaptability and teamwork in achieving project success.

**🔎Code analysis**
<br>

During my programming studies at John Abbott, a government-mandated game programming course, akin to CS50's Introduction to Game Development, offered an immersive journey into code analysis. We dissected and understood the core components of game development, including sprite creation, playstate mechanics, and various game engines like matter.js.

Beyond analysis, we were tasked with implementing new features, such as introducing unique objects, utilizing tweening for smooth animations, and adjusting gravity to enhance game dynamics. This experience not only sharpened our analytical skills but also nurtured our innovative capacity in enriching existing game codebases.
