**Quiz Maker**
<br>
*School-work, Full-control, C#, Visual Studio, Wpf*

This is a project with the goal of applying all the knowledge I've gained during the first, second, and third semesters 
of my computer science studies at John Abbott College.
<br><br>
The project involves creating a quiz app that reads a text file 
to generate and play quizzes. Users will also have the option to save their scores if they choose. 
<br><br>What I learned: How front-end and back-end works, OOP
